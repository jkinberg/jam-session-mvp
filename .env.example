# Get a free API key at: https://ably.com/sign-up
#
# SECURITY NOTE:
# - For local development: Use root API key (full capabilities for testing)
# - For production (Vercel): Create a restricted API key with only:
#   - Subscribe capability
#   - Publish capability
#   - NO admin, history, stats, or other capabilities
#
# This limits potential damage if the key is extracted from client-side code.
